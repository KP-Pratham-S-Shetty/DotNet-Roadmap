# .NET 6-Month Roadmap 🚀

Welcome to my **6-month .NET learning roadmap** (July–December 2025)! This repository tracks my journey to master .NET backend development, focusing on C#, ASP.NET Core, unit testing, and real-world projects. I’m a .NET backend developer at EG A/S, aiming to level up my skills through daily practice and structured learning.

## Purpose
- 📚 Build a strong foundation in C# and .NET ecosystem.
- 🛠️ Develop practical skills via projects (e.g., REST API, Task Manager).
- ✅ Track progress using GitHub Projects and issues.
- 📖 Curate resources and document learnings.

## Repository Structure
| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `ROADMAP.md` | High-level timeline of learning goals (July–Dec 2025). |
| `docs/` | Detailed guides for each topic (e.g., C#, ASP.NET Core). |
| `resources/` | Tutorials, cheatsheets, and external links. |
| `projects/` | Source code for roadmap projects (e.g., CLI apps, APIs). |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` | Templates for roadmap tasks. |

## Roadmap Overview
See [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) for the full timeline. Key milestones:
- **July**: C# fundamentals, unit testing (NUnit, Fluent Assertions).
- **August**: Advanced C#, LINQ, async/await.
- **September**: ASP.NET Core basics, REST APIs.
- **October**: Entity Framework Core, database integration.
- **November**: Authentication, deployment, CI/CD.
- **December**: Capstone project (e.g., Task Manager API).

## How to Use
1. 📋 Check [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) for the timeline and goals.
2. 📅 View the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/YOUR_USERNAME/projects) for task tracking.
3. 🐛 Create issues for tasks using the provided template.
4. 📦 Explore `projects/` for code and `resources/` for learning materials.
5. 💬 Use Discussions for feedback or questions.

## Progress Tracking
- **GitHub Project**: Tasks are organized by month and status (To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Issues**: Each task is an issue with labels (e.g., `C#`, `ASP.NET`, `Beginner`).
- **Checklists**: Markdown checklists in issues and `ROADMAP.md` for granular progress.
